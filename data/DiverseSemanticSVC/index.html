                        Singing Voice Conversion (SVC) is a technique that enables any singer to perform any song. To
                        achieve this, it is essential to obtain speaker-agnostic representations from the source audio,
                        which poses a significant challenge. A common solution involves utilizing a semantic-based audio
                        pretrained model as a feature extractor. However, the degree to which the extracted features can
                        meet the SVC requirements remains an open question. This includes their capability to accurately
                        model melody and lyrics, the speaker-independency of their underlying acoustic information, and
                        their robustness for in-the-wild acoustic environments. In this study, we investigate the
                        knowledge within classical semantic-based pretrained models in much detail. We discover that the
                        knowledge of different models is diverse and can be complementary for SVC. To jointly utilize
                        the diverse pretrained models with mismatched time resolutions, we propose an efficient ReTrans
                        strategy to address the feature fusion problem. Based on the above, we design a Singing Voice
                        Conversion framework based on Diverse Semantic-based Feature Fusion (DSFF-SVC). Experimental
                        results demonstrate that DSFF-SVC can be generalized and improve various existing SVC models,
                        particularly in challenging real-world conversion tasks.
